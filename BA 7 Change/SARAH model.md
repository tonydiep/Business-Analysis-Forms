Shock -> Anger -> Rejection -> Acceptance -> Hope

## Shock

_Initially people are shocked when they hear about a change initiative. They may not understand the forces of change. They may be used to existing processes._

## Anger

_Shock gives way to anger. People begin to ask what the change means to them. Anger will be directed to outside forces such as leaders or business analysts._

## Rejection

_Anger fades into rejection of change. People try to carry on even if it's not an option._

## Acceptance

_People accept the change and learn the new processes._

## Hope

_People see positive benefits of the change. They see possibilities for improvement._
